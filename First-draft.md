# Meeting Assistant (name TBD)
  Takes care of all our meeting needs, from taking the meeting minutes, to managing upcoming discussions and it makes sure you are achieve the intent of the meeting in a better and hassle-free manner.
  
## Types of modes in Application :
* Call-to-action/Consenus-asking meeting
* Uni-directional or Monologue
* Scrum meetings/ Reoccurrent meetings.

## What can it do :
* It can fetch subject details from the Outlook meeting invites to make sure the issues to be discussed are covered and prompts if meeting deviates from the original discussion for long( a threshold you can manipulate).
* It summarizes the discussion with stress on major highlights and generates minutes at the end of meeting which is then sent automatically to meeting attendees without any human intervention.
* It can set future meetings based on looking for the target words.e.g lets meet tomorrow same time.
* In response to a question, it can count the votes of individual speakers and sentiment to judge agreement( partial,full or none).
* Helps to have a tally of the absentees in meeetings and can also keep a track of tasks to follow-up from previous discussions.
* For you it will provide a dashboard with upcoming meetings and tasks to be tackled before them.
